# Event-1-Payloads
Event 1 Payloads that I'm making public, cause I made them with audios :)

## How do you make Event 1 payloads?

- Grab an Audio from somewhere
- Put it in audacity and make it hella loud
- Send it through a soundboard
- Log your USpeak data (base64 string)
- Resend it how you would send the original E1 Earrape
